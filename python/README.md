This repo will contain python programs that I am testing and helpful information.

The basic formation of a python program is as follows:
    - You have a hashbang at the top to your interpreter typically #!/usr/bin/python3
    - You then have a comment """ this describes your module """
    - Followed by any imports that you need and two blank lines
    - You can now create any functions that you need using def myFun():
    - Remember to """ describe your function """
    - Code not in functions will run, if you plan to import use if __name__ == "__main__"
    - Place your code under this to prevent code from running during an import
    - You do not need this if not importing and just running the script stand alone
